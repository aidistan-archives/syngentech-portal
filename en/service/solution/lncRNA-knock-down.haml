%h2.am-margin-bottom-xs Introduction
%p.am-margin-top-0 Long non-coding RNAs (long ncRNAs, LncRNA) are non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. Large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries and more recently transcriptomic sequencing by next generation sequencing indicate that long noncoding RNAs number in the order of tens of thousands in mammals. As of January 2016, 141,353 LncRNA transcripts in human have been annotated in NONCODE. Growing evidence suggests that they are involved in a surprisingly wide variety of cellular functions, including regulation of gene transcription, post-transcriptional regulation and epigenetic regulation. However, only a relatively small proportion (less than two hundred) has been demonstrated to be biologically relevant. Therefore, having a better understanding of LncRNAs’ functional roles would advance our understanding of the complex cellular regulatory network.
%p Unlike protein coding genes, which have to conserve the codon usage and prevent frameshift mutations in a single long ORF, selection may conserve only short regions of LncRNAs that are constrained by structure or sequence-specific interactions. Therefore, LncRNA knockout is achieved by deleting large fragment of those conserved sequences instead of short indels for mRNA knockout.

%h2.am-margin-xs Scheme of LncRNA knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 technology
%p.am-margin-top-0 A large fragment of conserved sequences in a LncRNA is deleted through two nuclease digestion reactions mediated by gRNA-guided Cas9, which are followed by NEEJ repairing.
