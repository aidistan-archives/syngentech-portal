<p>Beijing SyngenTech Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as SyngenTech) is the first high-tech company dedicated to applying synthetic biotechnology in the field of biomedicine in China. SyngenTech announced that its first gene therapy product, SynOV1.1, developed based on domestically original synthetic biotechnology, had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials on November 27, 2020. It is used to treat alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-positive solid tumours, including advanced liver cancer, and plans to carry out Phase I/IIa clinical studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the United States soon.</p>

<h3>About SynOV1.1</h3>
<p>China is a major country in liver cancer. According to the 2018 Global Cancer Report, the number of liver cancer cases in China accounted for 46.7% of the world's cases, and the 5-year survival rate was only 12.1%. Currently, eight drugs have been approved globally to treat advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including Lenvatinib, "A+T" combination first-line therapy, Opdivo, Keytruda, Camrelizumab, and Cabozantinib, Ramucirumab, and Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab for second-line treatment. These findings indicate that advanced liver cancer's systematic treatment is about to usher in a golden age of multi-target immunotherapy.</p>
<p>SyngenTech has been committed to using synthetic biotechnology to develop therapeutic drugs and methods for major human diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases. The scientists who joined the SyngenTech designed and developed a gene circuit that can accurately identify tumours and improve the killing effect based on synthetic biotechnology and inserted the gene circuit into the adenovirus vector. They constructed a new type of oncolytic virus gene therapy drug platform, SynOV system, to accurately identify tumours, improve the immune microenvironment, and efficiently kill tumours.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies showed that Synov1.1, the first product developed by SyngenTech based on the Synov system, significantly improved the efficacy and safety of the treatment of HCC, indicating its strong clinical application value. SyngenTech said the product was recently approved for clinical trials by FDA, and the application for clinical trials in China is ongoing. In addition, new drugs targeting gastric and pancreatic cancer based on the Synov system are also in the preclinical development stage.</p>
<p>"The successful approval of Synov1.1 for clinical trials by the FDA is an epoch-making event," said Dr. Bin Chen, Chief Executive Officer of SyngenTech. It will be the first time in the world that immunotherapy optimized and modified by synthetic biology technology will be used to treat patients with advanced cancer. We are even more proud that our local team developed Synov1.1 from the laboratory research accumulation, the technology platform's progressive maturity, to the compliance production and all of the preclinical development. In addition to our sincere cooperation, we also want to thank our partners (Tsinghua University, China National Institute of Food and Drug Control, JOINN Biologics, White Oak, Yuanxing, etc.) for their strong support. We expect the upcoming seamless phase I/II A clinical trial to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and synergism of Synov1.1 with existing immunotherapies. Our goal is to bring this innovative drug with the great clinical potential to the masses of patients as soon as possible."</p>
<p>SyngenTech's chief scientist, department of automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing information science and technology, an associate professor at the national research center, Tsinghua university center for synthetic and systems biology commissioner, the association of Chinese pharmaceutical biotechnology synthetic biology technology branch of Dr. Xie Zhen director commissioner, said: "SynOV1.1 successful clinical trials of FDA permission, for synthetic biology used in drug research and development, is of great significance, shows that the synthesis of biological technology in China are already in the first echelon in the field of pharmaceutical research and development. The development team of SyngenTech has gained experience in the process of moving Synov from the laboratory stage to the clinical stage, which provides strong technical and talent support for the development of subsequent synthetic drug platforms. We also want to thank all those involved in supporting Synov, and we look forward to working with all of you to contribute to the future development of synthetic biology in medicine."</p>

<p>北京合生基因科技有限公司（以下简称合生基因）是中国首家致力于合成生物技术在生物医药领域应用的高新技术公司。2020年11月27日，合生基因宣布其基于国内原创的合成生物技术开发的首款基因治疗产品SynOV1.1获得美国FDA临床试验许可，用于治疗包括中晚期肝癌在内的甲胎蛋白（AFP）阳性实体瘤，并计划近期在美国Memorial Sloan Kettering癌症中心开展一/二a期临床研究。</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="${image1}"></img></div>
<h3>关于SynOV1.1</h3>
<p>中国是肝癌大国，2018年全球癌症报告的数据显示，中国肝癌发病人数占全球病例的46.7%，5年生存率仅为12.1%。目前，国内外已有8种药物获批用于治疗晚期肝细胞癌，包括仑伐替尼、“A+T”组合一线治疗、O药、K药、卡瑞利珠单抗、卡博替尼、雷莫芦单抗，以及纳武利尤单抗联合伊匹木单抗二线治疗。这些研究结果表明晚期肝癌系统治疗即将迎来多靶点联合用药的免疫治疗黄金时代。</p>
<p>合生基因一直致力于利用合成生物技术开发针对癌症和遗传疾病等人类重大疾病的治疗药物和方法。合生基因的科学家基于合成生物技术设计并开发了能够精准识别肿瘤和提高杀伤效果的基因线路，并将该基因线路插入到腺病毒载体中，构建了一种能够精准识别肿瘤，改善免疫微环境，高效杀伤肿瘤的新型溶瘤病毒基因治疗药物平台SynOV系统。</p>
<p>临床前研究显示，合生基因基于SynOV系统开发的第一款产品SynOV1.1显著提高了对肝细胞肝癌的治疗效果和安全性，表明其具有极强的临床应用价值。合生基因表示，该产品已于近期获得美国FDA临床试验许可，同时在中国的临床试验申请正在进行中。此外，基于SynOV系统开发的靶向胃癌、胰腺癌新药也在临床前研发阶段。</p>
<p>合生基因首席执行官陈彬博士表示：“SynOV1.1能成功获得FDA的临床试验许可具有划时代的意义，因为这将是全球第一次将经过合成生物学技术优化、改造的免疫疗法用于治疗中晚期肿瘤病人，更让我们自豪的是，SynOV1.1从实验室的研究积累，到技术平台的逐步成熟，到合规化生产以及所有临床前开发都是由我们本土的团队完成，这里除了要感谢合生基因团队的精诚合作，也要感谢我们合作伙伴（清华大学、中检院、昭衍、白橡树、源兴等单位）的大力支持。我们期待即将开展的无缝连接一/二a期临床试验能同时显示SynOV1.1的安全性、有效性以及与现有免疫疗法的协同作用，我们努力的目标是将这一拥有巨大临床潜力的创新药尽早地带给广大患者。”</p>
<p>合生基因首席科学家，清华大学自动化系、北京信息科学与技术国家研究中心副教授，清华大学合成与系统生物学中心执委，中国医药生物技术协会合成生物技术分会主任委员谢震博士表示：“SynOV1.成功获得FDA的临床试验许可，对于合成生物学用于药物研发意义重大，表明我国的合成生物技术在医药研发领域已经处于国际第一梯队。合生基因的研发团队在将SynOV从实验室阶段推到临床研究阶段的过程中得到了历练，为推动后续合成药物平台的发展提供了有力的技术和人才保障。同时感谢所有参与支持SynOV项目的人，我们期待与大家共同努力为合成生物学在医药研发领域长足发展贡献力量。”</p>
